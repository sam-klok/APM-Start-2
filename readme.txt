After all new stuff in Angular 12, I decided to go back to Angular course 
"Angular" by Deborah Kurata from Pluralsight.

So this application APM-Start... done to the middle of course. 
I did it slightly differently from training.

thank you,

While working on it, I had and issue (below), and added answer on Stack Overflow:

Could not find module "@angular-devkit/build-angular"
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50333003/could-not-find-module-angular-devkit-build-angular

My answere (as a commment, because I don't have enough rating to answer):
Do you have folder node_modules ? For me the same error happened, 
when I cloned my Angular project through GitHub on different laptop. 
I didn't push folder node_modules to save space. 
Because I was on cell phone tethering, I decided do not reinstall all packages, 
but copy node_modules folder from different project on the same laptop. 
And it worked!
